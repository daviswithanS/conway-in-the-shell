# Conway in the Shell
A version of Conway's Game of Life, written in Python, that works in the command line.

## create_board.py
Use this program to create custom boards (stored in /boards) that are usable in the main conway.py program.

## conway.py
This program will run the main simulation, using 'sample_board.p' by default. If a board is not found, then it will generate a random grid of cells to carry out the simulation.

This program can be run with a number of flags to load custom boards or change the nature of the simulation.
